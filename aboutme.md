### Who is Anthony Munoz

I am someone who is currently breaking into the technology industry. Here are some of my interests:

- Cybersecurity (What I'm trying to really break into)
- General Programming (Improving daily, but more like weekly/monthly)

### My story

I am a current Master's student in Computer Science, graduating May 2024. I am excited to break into the industry.

I hope posting what I learn via blog posts show my progress. Look forward to it! :)
