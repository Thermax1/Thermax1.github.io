## Active Defense and Cyber Deception Day 1

Welcome to my short blog series about me taking Antisyphon Training's Active Defense and Cyber Deception class. My goals for this series is as follows:

1. Accountability for myself to take notes and pay attention.
2. Have proof that I learned something.
3. Have fun

### Hour 1

First and foremost, John Strand has a great presentation attitude. You can tell he's into what he's talking about, talks about it well, and really makes this 4-hour class a breeze.

The first thing I learned about was [MITRE Engage](https://engage.mitre.org). The official site says that MITRE Engage is a framework for planning and discussing engagement operations to achieve your cybersecurity goals. Basically, don't just throw up a firewall and call it a day.

Then, I finally learned what **Active Defense** and **Cyber Deception** mean.

- Active Defense: In simple terms, use techniques/tools to deny your enemy more ground. In an active defense scenario, they're already inside.
- Cyber Deception: A calculated process where one deceives attackers.
  - Make your enemy WORK harder, giving more time to detect them and potentially stopping them.

Sadly, cyber deception isn't in NIST (yet) so its most likely not going to be part of an organization's compliance requirements. What does this mean? It means organizations don't use it.

So, why do we care about cyber deception? The analogy John Strand said of *"think poison, not venom"* is what struck me. Let the enemy create their own demise. The more time they're fumbling around in your network due to your preparation, the better chance they finally trip something that allows you to detect and respond to the threat.

### Hour 2

After our state-mandated 10-minute break, we go off into hour 2. My favorite part of this hour is learning that SANS has a robots.txt page. I guess you can also call it a "disallow" page. Essentially, don't try poking into anything listed on that, otherwise, your IP (and you) will be blacklisted off the site.
