## Active Defense and Cyber Deception Day 1

Welcome to my short blog series about me taking Antisyphon Training's Active Defense and Cyber Deception class. My goals for this series is as follows:

1. Accountability for myself to take notes and pay attention.
2. Have proof that I learned something.
3. Have fun
